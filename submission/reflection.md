### ✍️ Project Reflection

**AI Tools Used**
For this project, I primarily used **ChatGPT** to guide the design and structure of my Python weather program. It helped me understand how to organise code into logical functions, use APIs effectively, and visualise data using Matplotlib and Pandas. The explanations provided also deepened my understanding of parsing techniques with regular expressions.

**Prompting Techniques**
I used **step-by-step prompting**, where I asked one focused question at a time—such as how to parse a question, visualise data, or use `main()`. I also refined prompts by requesting simpler explanations or structured examples.

**What Worked Well**
I’m proud of how I learned to combine different Python concepts—API integration, regex, and data visualisation—into one cohesive, working program. It made the project feel like a real-world application.

**What Would You Do Differently**
If I had more time, I’d improve the user interface, possibly by adding a graphical dashboard or utilising Streamlit to make it more interactive.

**Final Thoughts**
This experience taught me how to collaborate productively with AI as a learning assistant. It improved my coding confidence and problem-solving process.
